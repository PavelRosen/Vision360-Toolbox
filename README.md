## For Developers: Building from Source

If you want to run or modify the source code, follow these steps:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Python 3.x
    *   **Insta360 Media SDK (Crucial Requirement):** This project is a wrapper around the official SDK and **will not run** without it. To get the necessary components, you need to request the **full, pre-compiled SDK** from Insta360 directly via their developer channels. The public **[C++ SDK GitHub repository](https://github.com/Insta360Develop/Desktop-MediaSDK-Cpp)** is available for reference, but may not contain the required executable demos and models.
    *   **System Tools:** Install `exiftool` and `ffprobe` using your system's package manager (e.g., `sudo apt install exiftool ffmpeg`).

2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PavelRosen/Vision360-Toolbox.git
    cd Vision360-Toolbox
    ```

3.  **Install Python libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install tkintermapview gpxpy
    ```

4.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python vision360.py
    ```
